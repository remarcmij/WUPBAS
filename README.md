# WUBBAS

A scripting language engine for Windows 3.1 written in C, that I wrote in 1993 as companion to a software installation tool named **Win Update**. This tool was used within my employer's company, Shell Internationale Petroleum Mij to distribute Windows applications throughout Shell's head office in The Hague. The source code in this repo compiled to a 16-bit Windows DLL, and provided scripting services to the host application.
